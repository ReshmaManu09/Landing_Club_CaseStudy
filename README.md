# Lending Club Case Study
## Business Objective
The primary source of financial loss for lenders is extending loans to 'risky' applicants, resulting in credit loss â€“ the amount lost when borrowers fail to repay or default. The key objective is to effectively identify these high-risk loan applicants, enabling a reduction in such loans and subsequently minimizing credit loss. This case study aims to employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze and understand the influential factors or driver variables contributing to loan default. By identifying strong indicators of default, the company can leverage this knowledge for portfolio management and risk assessment, facilitating informed decision-making in lending practices.
### Problem Statement
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
